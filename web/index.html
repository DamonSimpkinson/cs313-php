    <h3>Our Family's Journey into Tae Kwon Do</h3>
    <p>Recently our daughters along with my wife and I have started participating
      in Tae Kwon Do.  This has been a great way to spend time together as a family
      as well as a way to get us all more active.  Our youngest daughter started
      in February and then our oldest daughter, my wife and I started in May.  Since
      starting, our oldest daughter has been invited to join the school's demonstration
      team and our daughters and I have participated in one tournament.  Here is our
      youngest daughter receiving a first place trophy at that tournament.</p>

      <h3>My Time in the Military</h3>
      <p>I spent 8 years serving in the US Navy as a nuclear power plant operator.
        It was during this time that I met my wife and our first two children were born.
        I spent 2 years as a student, 4 years as an operator and 2 years as an instructor.  The
        majority of my time in the navy was spent assigned to the USS Arkansas (CGN-41).
        During my time on the Arkansas I visited various ports along the west coast, Canada,
        Alaska, Hawaii, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australlia and Bahrain.</p>
